phpMyAPRS

Copyright (c) Morten Johansen <morten@bzzt.no> and contributors.

A PHP framework for communicating with the APRS-IS network.
This framework is released for use under the GPLv3 license as attached.

The latest version can be found on https://github.com/Hamlabs/phpMyAPRS

To get started copy the config-dist.ini to config.ini and configure
your callsign and other preferences.

The command "php comm.php" will start a process that forks into a read
and a write process. phpMyAPRS will parse all incoming packets into
objects.
The goal is to have a queue for outgoing messages, and a way to set up
rules and code to do what you want with incoming packets of all kinds.
